# Vocab-Bot-V2
More powerful than [Vocab-Bot (V1)](https://github.com/ChiefChippy2/Vocab-Bot) 
# What is different from V1?

 1. Addition of smart searching : The bot will be able to search for lists, and automatically do the spelling bee.
 2. Trial and Error : If the bot has trouble with a word, it will learn the definition and use it afterwards
 3. Fail-safe : The bot will not freeze on a word.
# How do I use it?

Go to https://vocabulary.com/lists/ and watch netflix for 3 hours while the magic operates! Also : This won't count in your class overall score I believe. 
P.S - your computer might be laggy.
